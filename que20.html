    <h2>que20</h2>
    <p> Write a pr ogr am that r eads two number s A and B and checks, If A
        is less than or equal to B . If B is less than or equal to A . Print
        the r esult as shown in the sample output.
        Explanation:
        For example, if the given numbers are A = 5 and B = 3 ,
        A is less than or equal to B . ( 5 is not less than or equal to 3)
        B is less than or equal to A . ( 3 is less than or equal to 5)
        The output should be
        A <= B is False
        B <= A is True</p>
